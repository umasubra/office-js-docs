*   [Body](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/body.md): Represents the body of a document or a section.
*   [ContentControl](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/contentControl.md): A ContentControl object is a container for content. It is a bound and potentially labeled region in a document that serves as a container for specific types of content. For example, content controls can contain contents such as paragraphs of formatted text and other content controls. You can access a content control through the content control collection of the document, document body, paragraph, range, or on a content control.
*   [Document](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/document.md): The Document object is the top-level object. A Document object contains one or more [sections](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/section.md), a body that contains the content of the document, and header/footer information.
*   [Font](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/font.md): The Font object provides text formatting to a body, content control, paragraph, or range.
*   [Image](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/inlinePicture.md): Represents an inline picture anchored to a paragraph.
*   [Paragraph](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/paragraph.md): A Paragraph object represents a single paragraph in a selection, range, or document. You can access a paragraph through the paragraphs collection in a selection, range, or document.
*   [Range](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/range.md): A Range object represents a contiguous area in a document. You get a Range object when you get a selection, insert content into the body, insert content into a content control, insert content into a paragraph, or get a search result. You can define and manipulate a range without changing the selection.
*   [Section](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/section.md): A Section object is commonly used to define different header and footers as well as different page layout configurations of a document. You can access sections from the Document object.

[Selection](Word%20Add-ins%20JavaScript%20Reference/document.md#getselection): The document object gives you access to the user's selection in the document, or the current insertion point, if nothing is selected.
